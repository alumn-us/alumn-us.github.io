								<p>Your True Ambassadors: Who else can be better representative of your institution other than your Alumni? They have been through it and they are the one who are most trusted source of feedback for potential new-comers.</p>
								<p>Nostalgia: Whenever an alumnus hears about his/her alma-mater, he/she is bound to travel in past for a while. And just imagine the excitement and curiosity they would be experiencing when they visit their alma-mater.</p>
								<p>Professional Networking platform: When things are already in common, why one would need ice breakers! After years of exploring the world, every alumnus has the need to maximize the network which is required for future prospects and certainties. Through this platform, they can easily bond personally or professionally with anyone they look for which in turn helps them in career and growth.<p>
								<p>Fund Raiser: Your alumni are the ones who can make available those projects which you always dreamt of. Include them in your purpose and see how fast things get to reality. Everyone loves giving back to society.<p>
								<p>Offering Guidance to Existing ones: Since they have moved forward and hence they have many stories, insights and much experience to discuss and share with existing students/employees etc. Alumni can help in many explored & unexplored ways to current students.
